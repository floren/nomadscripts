These are hacky as hell, but they're the best thing I've found for actually getting stuff off my old Nomad Xtra.

To use the scripts, you shouldn't need anything except the njb-tools package (that's what it is on Debian, and probably on Ubuntu, everyone else is on their own).

Before you run either of the Perl scripts, you need to get a listing of files and tracks on your device. Run the "getlistings.sh" script.

files.pl will download data files into nomad-files/. Beware that it will take a LONG time.

tracks.pl will download your music into nomad-songs/. It's a lot faster than files.pl.
